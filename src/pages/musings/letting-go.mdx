Hey akash how are you doing today ?

Akash you learn to let it go by realizing that you never had it to begin with! 
It was always just a illusion!

Do you control what the weather would be like today ?
What about earths rotation around the sun?
What about what nerouns to fire in your brain ?
Maybe instructing your motor proteins to transfer nutrients 
Maybe instructing your immune system to fight off that cold. 

You get the idea, universe takes care of the minute of the details to the very vast details than what makes you think you do have control ?

More importantly, if it can take care of all those things, what makes you think it can’t take care of you too ?

The answer is, it’ll take care of you if you let it go. 

Think about it. 

Akash
