One of my friend was lightly criticising this dude at the gym who apparently was doing some odd gym routines with improper form. It reminded me of two very important lessons I learned in life,   

1. Never criticise people for making mistakes cause you could have made those same mistakes yourself! When I first started going to gym, I made almost all the 'wrong' choices. So honestly I don't get the right to say anyone that they're wrong.  
  
And if you do want to criticise, criticise the mistake rather than the person. i.e. yo I think you're pushing it too low and might hurt your shoulders vs yo you're doing it wrong. The first attacks the problem, it's inclusive. Whereas second attacks the person, it's exclusive.  
  

2. Always have an open mind. Sometimes when we have invested so much time and effort into something and if some 'outsider' comes along and points out that we're doing it 'wrong', we tend to get very defensive! This really stops us from learning and growing.  
  
I've been learning to set aside my ego and try to learn what the 'outsider' has to say! And lot of the times they're actually right! Sometimes they may be incorrect cause they don't have the context. Regardless, I always thank them for sharing their point of view!
