Akash, the root of all your fear is the unknown unknowns which cannot be predicted. Or controlled.

And you know what, the fear of the unknown will always be with you no matter what you do.

I think that’s comforting in a way: if there’s nothing you can do to change it, there’s no reason to let it stop you!
